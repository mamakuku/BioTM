ABSTRACT:
Introduction ¡V For the characterisation of grape cultivars, the profile and content of flavonoids are important because these compounds impact grape and wine quality. To determine the correct profile and content of flavonoids, the use of robust, sensitive and reliable methods is necessary.
Objective ¡V The object of this research is to develop a new ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) method for the recovery of flavonoids from grape skins using response surface methodology.
Method ¡V Optimisation ofUAE was performed using a complementary study combining a Box-Behnken experimental design with qualitative analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography.
Results ¡V Optimal extraction conditions were obtained using the extraction solvent composed of acetonitrile:water:formic acid (26:73:1, v/v/v) at an extraction temperature of 50¢XC, an extraction time of 15min in a single-extraction step and with a solidto-solvent ratio of 1:80g/mL. The calculated relative standard deviations for the optimal extraction method were very low, measuring less than 5%.
Conclusions ¡V This study demonstrates that numerous factors have strong effects on the extraction efficiency, including the type of organic modifier and its percentage in the extraction solvent, the number of extraction steps, the solid-to-solvent ratio, the extraction time and temperature and, finally, the particular nature of analyte and their position within the grape skin cell.

Introduction
Grapes are an important horticultural crop in the world, with an annual production greater than 69 million tons in 2012. The majority of the harvest fruit is processed into wine (OIV Statistical Report, 2013). The quality of wine produced depends on many factors such as grape genotype, climate, soil, canopy management and stage of maturity ( Jackson and Lombard, 1993). The importance of harvesting at a given maturity stage has been recognised. Grapes are harvested at the stage of technological maturity, which can vary significantly according to the type of the wine to be produced. Traditionally, technological maturity has been determined by the amount and ratio of sugars and acids in grapes. Presently, it is well known that wine quality is considerably influenced by the composition and con-mass spectrometry (MS) detector as well as various spectrophotometric methods for determination of total contents of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols and tannins. Regardless of the selection method for the analysis of phenolic compounds, it is first necessary to conduct the extraction process. The extraction method must be fast, accurate, robust, sensitive and reliable. Currently, the most frequently applied techniques are different solid¡Vliquid extraction methods for the extraction of grape flavonoids (Lorrain et al., 2013). These traditional methods of extraction are very time-consuming and often require relatively large volumes of organic solvents. During the last few years, various new extraction techniques have been used for the recovery ofKeywords: Grape skins; ultrasound-assisted extraction; flavonoids; multi-response optimisation

tent of phenolic compounds, in particular, flavonoids. Optimal contents of sugars/acids and different phenolic compounds do not typically coincide in time. Therefore, to determine the appropriate harvest date, it is necessary to consider phenolic maturity, as well (Fragoso et al., 2010).
¡@Methods for analysing phenolic compounds include highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods with a diode array detector (DAD), a fluorescence detector (FLD) and

flavonoids from different plant matrices, such as microwaveassisted extraction (MAE) (Routray and Orsat, 2012), pressurised liquid extraction (PLE) (Mustafa and Turner, 2011) and ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) (Vilkhu et al., 2008, Esclapez et al., 2011, Ramic et al., 2015).
¡@Various studies have shown that, in comparison with traditional extraction methods, the application of UAE leads to shorter extraction time, lower solvent consumption and increased extraction yield. UAE is based on the propagation of ultrasonic waves into liquid media. This wave propagation causes the variation of distances between the molecules of a liquid. Exceeding the minimum molecular distance essential to hold liquids intact leads to liquid breakdown, and cavitation bubbles are formed. This cavitation process causes the breakdown of cell walls, which considerably enhances the diffusion of cell contents in bulky solvents. For UAE purposes, two common devices are used: ultrasonic baths and probes. Several factors affect UAE efficiency. The most prominent factors are as follows: the type, composition and volume of the solvent; the amount and particle size of the sample; the sonic power and frequency; the extraction time and temperature. This extraction technique is simple, cheap, fast, effective, and able to reduce the amount of organic solvent; additionally, several extractions can be performed simultaneously with this method (Vilkhu et al., 2008; Esclapez et al., 2011). Until today, few studies have verified the advantages of the application of UAE for the recovery of phenolic compounds from grape skins (Novak et al., 2008; Ghafoor et al., 2009; Carrera et al., 2012).
¡@The optimisation of extraction conditions is generally performed by one-factor-at-the-time methodology. This methodology does not consider the eventual interactions between the studied factors. The response surface methodology (RSM) approach allows the number of experiments to be minimised, and the effect of each factor and the interaction between the factors on extraction yield are evaluated simultaneously (Bezerra et al., 2008). Despite the fact that the application of RSM in the optimisation of the extraction method for the recovery of flavonoids from grapes brings such advantages as efficiency, economy, and objectivity, it appears that such methodology along with UAE techniques has only been implemented once in other research. Ghafoor et al. (2009) investigated the effect on total anthocyanins content of ethanol percentage in an extraction solvent and studied the extraction time and temperature. In that study the effect of using different organic solvents was not examined, notwithstanding the nature of solvents that determines extractability, nor the effect on different individual flavonoids.
¡@The aim of the present study is to optimise the UAE of flavonoids from grape skins with respect to type of organic solvent, percentage of organic phase in the extraction solvent, extraction temperature and extraction time. For this purpose, a BoxBehnken experimental design (BBD) was performed to estimate the effects of the factors listed on the yield of individual anthocyanins, flavonol glycosides and flavan-3-ols. Apart from the use of frequently applied and well-known organic solvents (ethanol and acetone), acetonitrile was used as the organic phase in the extraction solvent. Before setting the levels of the studied factors, preliminary experiments using the one-factorat-the-time methodology were performed. In preliminary experiments, the following factors were determined: the optimal range of extraction time, the solid-to-solvent ratio and the number of extraction steps.
Materials and methods
Chemicals
Acetonitrile and methanol of HPLC grade were purchased from J. T. Baker (Deventer, The Netherlands). Formic acid and 85% orthophosphoric acid were obtained from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Ethanol and acetone were provided by Kemika (Zagreb, Croatia).
¡@The standards used for identification and quantification purposes were as follows: delphinidin-3-O-glucoside, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, peonidin-3-O-glucoside, malvidin-3-O-glucoside, delphinidin-3,5-Odiglucoside, cyanidin-3,5-O-diglucoside, malvidin-3,5-O-diglucoside, epigallocatechin, procyanidin B1, procyanidin B2, rutin, and myricetin (Extrasynthese, Genay Cedex, France); ()-epicatechin, (+)-catechin and epicatechin-gallate (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA); quercetin and isorhamnetin (Fluka, Steinheim, Germany); quercetin-3-O-glucoside (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA).
Grape samples and preparation
Grape samples of cv. Regent, Vitis vinifera L. {VIVC number ¡V 4572 [Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) (http://www.vivc.de)]} were obtained in 2012 and 2013 from the National Collection of Grapevine Varieties located at the Experimental Station, Jazbina, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Zagreb, Croatia [HRV0411 (VIVC, http://www.vivc.de)]. Grapes were harvested in a state of full ripeness and immediately separated from the stalk. To obtain homogenous samples of the berries at a similar level of ripeness (sugar and flavonoid concentration), a simple flotation method was used with sucrose water solutions of different densities. For further analysis, grape berries with a density range of 1.088 to 1.099 g/cm3 were selected. The berry skins were manually removed from the pulp and air-dried until constant mass (7 days). The dry skins were ground (Coffee Grinder SMK150, Gorenje, Slovenia) and the powder obtained was stored in a glass container
(2¢XC).
Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) of flavonoids from grape skins
All experiments were conducted in a rectangular ultrasonic water bath (Sonorex Super RK 100 H, Bandelin Electronic, Berlin, Germany) with a useful volume of 2 L (internal dimensions: 24 cm ¡Ñ 14 cm ¡Ñ 10 cm) and operated at a constant ultrasonic power and frequency of 320 W and 35 kHz, respectively. After extractions were completed, supernatants were collected, concentrated under a vacuum to remove organic modifier (40¢XC) on a Hei ¡V Vap Adventage G3 rotary evaporator (Heidolph, Schwabach, Germany) and brought to a final volume of 10 mL with eluent A (water:phosphoric acid, 99.5:0.5, v/v). The extracts were filtered with a Phenex-PTFE 0.20 £gm syringe filter (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) and analysed by HPLC.
¡@Before setting the levels of the studied factors, some preliminary experiments using the one-factor-at-the-time methodology were necessary. The optimal range of extraction time (3¡V90 min) was determined in single-step extraction by an extraction solvent composed of ethanol:water:formic acid (70:29:1; v/v/v). The solid-tosolvent ratio was 1:40 g/mL (250 mg of grape skin powder and 10 mL of the extraction solvent) while the temperature was 50¢XC. The extract was centrifuged in a LC-321 centrifuge (Tehtnica, ?eleznik, Slovenia) for 20 min at 5000 rpm at room temperature.
¡@Determination of the optimal numbers of extraction steps was made by the same experimental conditions; however, the extraction duration was 10 min. In the case of single-step extraction (10 mL of extraction solvent), the supernatant was removed after 15 min of extraction followed by centrifugation. For the two-steps
(5 mL + 5 mL of extraction solvent) and three-step (4 mL + 3 mL + 3 mL of extraction solvent) extractions, a centrifugation was operated after 7.5 and 5 min of extraction, respectively. The supernatant was removed and fresh extraction solvent of an appropriate volume was added on the solid residue. This operation was repeated once in the case of the two-steps extraction and twice for the three-step extractions. The appropriate supernatants were coupled and concentrated under a vacuum.
¡@The optimal solid-to-solvent ratio was determined by the extraction solvent at the temperature described earlier, and the duration of extraction of 10 min with single-step extraction. The following ratios were examined: 1:40, 1:60 and 1:80 g/mL; the volume of the extraction solvent was fixed at 10 mL, and the mass of samples was 250, 165 and 125 mg, respectively.
All preliminary experiments were performed in triplicate.
Experimental design and statistical analysis
After determining the optimal conditions of the extraction factors through the single-factor tests, the effect of the three numeric factors (the percentage of organic phase in the extraction solvent, the extraction temperature and the extraction time) and one categorical factor (the type of organic solvent) on the yield of individual anthocyanins, flavonol glycosides and flavan-3-ols were studied through the BBD and RSM. BBD is very efficient for studies with a high number of factors. These four independent factors were investigated at three different coded levels (Table 1). The resulting contents of the 3-O-glucosides and 3,5-O-diglucosides of delphinidin, cyanidin, peonidin and malvidin; those of the 3-O-glycosides quercetin, myricetin and isorhamnetin and those of gallocatechin, procyanidin B1, procyanidin B2, catechin, epicatechin and epigallocatechin (Table 2) where used as responses (Y, dependent variables). The results of the BBD experiments were analysed by non-linear multiple regression with backward elimination to fit the following second-order equation to the dependent Y variables:
	Y ? £]0 ?£U£]ixi ?£U£]ijxixj ?£U£]iixi2	?i ? 1; 2; ¡K; k?	(1)
where £]0, £]i, £]ii and £]ij are the coefficients for the linear, quadratic and interaction effects, respectively; xi and xj are the levels of independent factors in the coded values. Coefficients were interpreted using an F-test. To establish the optimum conditions for individual anthocyanin content (AC), flavonol glycoside content

D: Type of organic solvent	Acetonitrile	Ethanol	Acetone(FGC) and flavan-3-ol content (FC), analysis of variance (ANOVA), regression analysis and plotting of the response surface plot were conducted. For optimisation, multicriteria methodology (Derringer function or desirability function) was used. This methodology is applied when various responses must be considered at the same time, and it is necessary to find optimal compromises between the total numbers of considered responses. The optimal experimental conditions were based on the maximal content of the individual flavonoids. When the target value (T) for response Y is greatest, the individual desirability (d) is described by the following equation:
< 1
d ? >>	 if L?Y?T	(2) s
>>: 1 if Y > T
where L is the lower acceptable value to the response, and s is the weight. Thus, when s = 1, the desirability function is linear. When s > 1 is chosen, major importance is given to the points near the target value. When s < 1 is chosen, the last demand is of low importance. The individual desirability functions are then combined into a global desirability (D) using the geometric mean (Equation 3):
	D ? ?d1d2¡Kdm?1=m	(3)
where m is number of responses studied in the optimisation process. Thus, the simultaneous optimisation process is reduced to find the levels of factors that demonstrate the maximum overall desirability (Bezerra et al., 2008).
¡@The analysis of the experimental design and calculation of the predicted data was completed using the Design Expert software (Trial Version 9.0.3.1, Stat-Ease Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA).
¡@The mean values, standard deviations and significant differences of the data were calculated and reported using OriginPro 8 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA). The results were analysed with ANOVA, and the differences between the means were evaluated by Tukey¡¦s post hoc test at a confidence level of 95% (p < 0.05). The data reported in all of the tables were the average of triplicate observation.
HPLC analysis
The separation, identification and quantification of flavonoids from grape skin extracts were performed on an Agilent 1100 Series system (Agilent, Germany) equipped with an autosampler, column thermostat, DAD, FLD and coupled to an Agilent Chem Station data-processing station. The separation was performed with a reversed-phase column Luna Phenyl-Hexyl [4.6 ¡Ñ 250 mm; 5 £gm particle (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA)], with a Phenyl guard column (4.0 ¡Ñ 3.0 mm) at a set temperature of 50¢XC. The solvents were water:phosphoric acid (99.5:0.5, v/v, eluent A) and acetonitrile:water:phosphoric acid; 50:49.5:0.5, v/v/v, eluent B), and the flow rate was 0.9 mL/min. The linear gradient for eluent B was: 0 min, 0%; 7 min, 20%; 35 min, 40%; 40 min, 40%; 45 min, 80%; 50 min, 100%; 60 min, 0%. The injection volume for all samples was 20 £gL. The DAD was set to an acquisition range of 200 to 700 nm. Using DAD, flavonol glycosides were detected at 360 nm, and anthocyanins were detected at 518 nm. Using FLD, flavan-3-ols were detected at £fex = 225 nm and £fem = 320 nm.

For peak assignment, grape extracts were analysed with an Agilent 1200 Series system (Agilent, Germany) coupled in line to an Agilent model 6410 mass spectrometer fitted with an electrospray ionisation (ESI) source. The separation was performed with the column described in the previous section. The mass spectra of flavan-3-ols and flavonols were recorded in the negative mode and those of anthocyanins in the positive mode. The negative and positive ion mass spectra of the column eluate were recorded in the range m/z 100  1000. The ESI parameters were drying gas (N2) flow and temperature, 8 L/min and 300¢XC, respectively; the nebuliser pressure was 30 psi, the capillary voltage was 4500 V for the negative ion mode or 4500 V for the positive ion mode. The fragmentation voltage was 135 V.
Quantification of individual compounds
Individual flavonoids in berry skin extracts were identified by matching the retention time of each chromatographic peak with external standards and DAD spectrum. Quantification of individual flavonoid peaks was completed using a calibration curve of the corresponding standard compound. When reference compounds were not available, the calibration of a structurally related compound was used. The results are expressed in milligrams per kilogram of dry weight (d.w.) of grape skin. In preliminary tests contents of particular class of flavonoids, namely AC, FGC and FC, were expressed as sum of content of individual compounds determined by HPLC.
Results and discussion
Selection of organic phase for extraction solvent
The type of extraction solvent has considerable impact on extraction yield. Solubility of flavonoids is governed by the polarity of the solvents used. Depending on the solvent system used for extraction, a mixture of different compounds, such as flavonoids and non-phenolic compounds (sugars, organic acids and fats), soluble in the solvent will be extracted from grape skins. To achieve excellent effectiveness and good selectivity, it is necessary to select the appropriate extraction solvent. Methanol and ethanol have similar physico-chemical properties. Lapornik et al. (2005) demonstrated that ethanol is a better organic modifier for the extraction of phenolic compounds. The use of high frequency ultrasound may increase the formation of OH radicals. Radical production can be quenched by the addition of small amounts of ethanol. Ethanol can lower the temperature inside the cavitation bubbles and change the chemistry involved (Riesz et al., 1985; Vilkhu et al., 2008). Thus, based on these observations and the fact that ethanol is environmentally benign and relatively safe for human health, it was chosen as the organic modifier in the following experiments. According to the literature, acetone is an excellent solvent for the recovery of flavan-3-ols, particularly for the extraction of oligomeric and polymeric forms (Ivanova et al., 2011). Based on the experience gained during the development of the HPLC method for the separation of flavonoids (Tomaz and Maslov, 2015), acetonitrile was selected as a third organic phase. Flavonoids, especially anthocyanins, are most stable at very low pH when they are in flavylium form; thus, it is necessary to conduct extraction in an acidic environment. Acylated anthocyanins and flavonol glycosides are labile in solutions containing mineral acid, so it is necessary in the extraction solvent to add a weaker acid such as formic acid. By adding formic acid in the extraction solvent, a significant recovery increase was observed for all of the examined flavonoids (data not shown). Bakker and Timberlake (1985) indicated that artefacts such as formylated derivates of anthocyanins could be obtained using an extraction solvent containing 2% formic acid. By close inspection of the chromatograms recorded at 518 nm after injection of the extract obtained by an extraction solvent containing 1% formic acid, these artefacts are not observed. Based on the obtained results, extraction solvents with the appropriate organic phases and 1% formic acid were selected for further experiments.
Selection of temperature range
The temperature of extraction is an important factor. It can affect the viscosity of the extraction solvent. At higher temperatures, the viscosity of the obtained extracts decrease and faster diffusion occurs. These phenomena may lead to an increase in the extraction yield. Higher temperatures also help to disrupt the strong solute¡Vmatrix interactions such as the hydrogen bonds and the dipole interaction between the solute and matrix. During implosion, very high temperatures are reached inside the cavitation bubbles. When using a non-thermostated ultrasonic bath, throughout continuous ultrasonication, the bulk liquid temperature increases to its equilibrium temperature. To conduct the extraction at a precise temperature, it is mandatory to determine the equilibrium temperature (Capelo-Mart?nez, 2009). This temperature was reached after 90 min of ultrasonication, and it was 50¢XC, regardless of the initial temperature of the bulk liquid (Supporting Information Fig. S1). Based on this observation, the temperature range between 50 and 70¢XC was selected in the experimental design.
Effect of extraction time on recovery of flavonoids
The contents of anthocyanins, flavonol glycosides and flavan-3-ols at different extraction times are presented in Fig. 1. Extraction was conducted for different times periods (3, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 min) while the following factors were constant: solid-to-solvent ratio 1:40 g/mL, single-step extraction and temperature of 50¢XC. A significant increase of AC was observed between 5 and 15 min. The same trend follows FGC and FC. Longer extraction times led to a decrease of AC and FGC, but FC remained at a relatively steady value. Therefore, in the experimental design time periods between 5 and 15 min were used.
Influence of the number of extraction steps
The influence of the number of extraction steps on AC, FGC and FC is shown in Fig. 2. A series of experiments consisting of the extraction of a constant solid-to-solvent ratio, temperature, time and extraction solvent, e.g. a single-step extraction, two-steps extraction and three-step extraction, were performed to determine the number of required extraction steps to obtain the highest yield of flavonoids. Extraction of all of the studied compounds depended on the number of extraction steps, and it was significant lower with multistep extraction. Increasing the number of extraction steps led to relatively linear decrease of flavonoid yield. The calculated relative standard deviations (RSDs) were the highest in the case of the three-step extractions, which could be explained by the frequent transfer sample from one vessel to another.
Effect of solid-to-solvent ratio. To determine the most appropriate solid-to-solvent ratio, different ratios were examined (1:40, 1:60 and 1:80 g/mL) while the following factors were constant: single-step extraction, extraction solvent, extraction time of

10 min, and temperature of 50¢XC. The effect of the solvent-to-solid ratio on AC, FGC and FC is depicted in Fig. 3. By increasing the solid-to-solvent ratio, a relatively linear increase of AC, FGC and FC was observed. These differences are less pronounced in case of flavan-3-ols. In all of the studied cases, the highest yield was observed with the solid-to-solvent ratio of 1:80 g/mL, which is in close agreement with the findings of Cacace and Mazza (2003). Increasing the flavonoid yields with the increase of the solid-to-solvent ratio is consistent with mass transfer principles. The driving force during mass transfer within a solid is the concentration gradient, which was greater when a higher solid-to-solvent ratio was used, resulting in a diffusion rate increase (Cacace and Mazza, 2003).
Optimisation of extraction conditions by response surface methodology (RSM)
According to results obtain by the single-tests, the levels of extraction parameters were chosen; 45 experimental conditions, including three replicates at the centre point, were generated (Supporting Information Table S1). The type of organic solvent, percentage of organic modifier in the extraction solvent, extraction time and temperature are considered as independent factors while the solid-to-solvent ratio of 1:80 g/mL (125 mg of grape skins powder and 10 mL of the appropriate extraction solvent) and single-step extraction were fixed.
¡@Fitting the data with various models showed that contents of nearly all of the targeted compounds were best described with a quadratic polynomial model. The significance of the model as well as each regression coefficient were evaluated by ANOVA. Using backward elimination, insignificant model terms were removed. The determination coefficient (R2), p-values of model as well as those of lack of fit, adjusted R2, predicted R2 and adequate precession are parameters that describe adequacy of the model. For the model to be significant, the model p-value must be less than 0.05 while the lack of fit p-value must be greater than 0.05. The difference between the adjusted R2 and the predicted R2 must be less than 0.2. When this difference is more than 0.2, it may indicate a large block effect or possible problem with model and/or data. A negative value of the predicted R2 implies that the overall mean is a better predictor of response than the current model. Values greater than four are preferable for adequate precession measures of the signal-to-noise ratio. To diagnose abnormalities, trends and normality of the residual, Box¡VCox analysis, residual vs. run, plot of normal run and residual vs. predicted analyses were used. The Box¡VCox plot provides a guideline for selecting the correct power law transformation if it is necessary. The coefficients of the model equation together with parameters that describe model adequacy were determined (Supporting Information Table S2).
¡@The most significant factor in all of the examined cases was the type of solvent. Acetonitrile was the most appropriate organic modifier for the majority of compounds (Table 3). For diglucoside of delphinidin and cyanidin as well as for rutin and myricetine3-O-glucoside, the most effective organic modifier was ethanol. Acetone was the best modifier for dimeric forms of flavan-3-ols and catechin. This organic solvent is not an appropriate solvent for the recovery of anthocyanins, regardless of its percentage in the extraction solvent. Lu and Foo (2001) investigated unusual anthocyanin reactions with acetone. They observed the formation of pyranoanthocyanins after 3-days of reaction at 40¢XC. These compounds have an absorption maximum approximately at 480 nm. By close inspection of some of the peaks in the chromatograms obtained after the injection of acetonic extract, some unusual coelutions and new peaks were observed at 360 nm. These compounds have absorption maximums approximately at 480 nm, so they may be pyranoanthocyanidins formed by the reaction of acetone with anthocyanin monoglucosides (Supporting Information Fig. S2). These compounds are observed in all extracts obtained by aqueous acetone, regardless of acetone percentage, extraction time and extraction temperature. They were most abundant in extracts obtained by 80% acetone at 50¢XC after 10 min of extraction.
¡@The organic phase percentages in the extraction solvent have great effect on yield on extraction for all compounds of interest. Depending on the nature of the target compounds and the organic solvent, this percentage can be 20% for more polar compounds and up to 80% for less polar compounds. Temperature is also important factor. For most of the analysed compounds, the optimal temperature was 50¢XC. Anthocyanins are sensitive to temperature, especially above 70¢XC. The rate of degradation of anthocyanins is time and temperature dependent. Temperature dependence of the degradation of anthocyanins has been demonstrated to follow first-order kinetics. The values of reaction rate constant (0.004 h1) and half-life (70.54 h) were determined at the temperature of 50¢XC (Cemeroglu et al., 1994). In a previous study grape skin extracts were subjected to sonication at temperature of 50¢XC. During the sonication of grape skin extracts in period of 15 min degradation of anthocyanins was negligible. Ratio between AC determined after 15 min of sonication and control ( grape skin extract which was not subjected to sonication) was 0.9968 (unpublished data). These results are in closely agreement with results obtained in the study conducted by Cemeroglu et al. (1994). Temperature higher than 50¢XC has a positive effect on the recovery of flavan-3-ols. The duration of extraction strongly depends on the chemical nature of the compounds; likewise, their position in the grape skin cell also influences the extraction duration. Longer extraction times have great benefit on the extraction of the majority of flavan-3-ols. Throughout extraction in an acidic environment, the hydrolysis of tannins may occur. Grape skin tannins are composed of monomeric forms of flavan-3-ols interconnected by flavan bonds. Over the course of longer extractions, more hydrolysis products of tannins can appear in the extracts.
¡@The interactions of the extraction factors were studied from the contour plots. Circular contour plots indicate that the interaction between the corresponding variables is negligible, while elliptical contours suggest that the interactions between the corresponding variables are significant (Liu et al., 2013). It was observed that, for most compounds, a clear interaction between the various extraction factors exists (Supporting Information Figs S3¡VS5).
¡@Individual flavonoids were differentially affected by the percentage of organic modifier and the extraction temperature showing positive, negative or negligible influence (Supporting Information Fig. S3). Lower percentage of organic modifier and lower extraction temperature increased the content of cyanidin-3,5-O-diglucoside, malvidin-3,5-O-diglucoside, malvidin-3-O-glucoside, myricetin-3-Oglucoside, quercetin-3-O-glucuronide, kaempferol-3-O-glucuronide and procyanidin B1. Conversely, lower temperature and high percentage of organic modifier had a positive effect on the recovery of peonidin-3-O-glucoside, quercetin-3-O-glucoside and gallocatechin. Higher temperature and lower percentage of organic modifier were favourable for epigallocatechin and catechin. The effect of the interaction between the percentage of organic modifier and the duration of extraction depended on the chemical nature of the studied compounds (Supporting Information Fig. S4). Higher percentage of organic modifier and longer duration of extraction increased the content of quercetin-3-O-glucoside and epicatechin. Longer duration and lower percentage of organic modifier were favourable for cyanidin-3,5-O-diglucoside, peonidin-3,5-O-diglucoside, malvidin3,5-O-diglucoside, kaempferol-3-O-glucuronide, myricetin-3-Oglucoside and rutin. Shorter duration and lower percentage of organic modifier were beneficial only for quercetin-3-O-glucoside and procyanidin B1.
¡@For the majority of examined compounds, low temperatures and shorter duration of extraction were beneficial (Supporting Information Fig. S5). However, high temperatures and longer duration of extraction had a positive effect on the recovery of epicatechin and kaempferol-3-O-glucuronide. Longer duration and low temperature increased the content of cyanidin-3,5-Odiglucoside, myricetin-3-O-glucoside, all types of glycosides of quercetin and gallocatechin.

For the optimisation of these conditions, multicriteria methodology was used (Derringer function or desirability function). The determination of the optimal extraction conditions was based on the maximum content of individual anthocyanins, flavonol glycosides and flavan-3-ols, together. All of the responses had the same importance (5), and the overall desirability was 0.815 (Table 3). Different ranges of temperature, time and percentage of organic modifier gave a desirability of 0.81; these ranges are very narrow. The optimal range of temperature must be 50¡V50.4¢X C, the range of percentage of organic modifier from 20% to 33%, while the optimal range of time must be 14 min and 49 sec through 15 min to achieve the earlier mentioned desirability. With these requirements in mind, the following optimal extraction conditions are determined: extraction solvent composed of acetonitrile:water:formic acid (26:73:1, v/v/v), extraction temperature of 50¢XC, extraction time of 15 min and in a single-extraction step with a solid-to-solvent ratio of 80 g/mL.
Verification of model
The suitability of the model equations for the optimum response values is tested using the selected optimal conditions (Table 3). The experimental values are very close to the predicted values, consequently indicating that the RSM models are satisfactory and accurate (Tables 3 and 4). To evaluate the reproducibility and precision of the new optimised UAE method, RSDs were calculated. The reproducibility and the precision of the optimised UAE method were satisfactory. The calculated RSD values were less than 5% for all of the examined compounds. The highest RSD values were calculated for individual flavan-3-ols. This can be explained by their low content and chemical nature. During extraction, these compounds can hydrolyse, isomerise or can arise as hydrolysis products of tannins. A low percentage of acetonitrile exists in the extraction solvent, so there is no need for it to be removed by evaporation in vacuum before HPLC analysis, which greatly improves the precision and accuracy of the method and contributes to a low RSD value.
¡@Based on literature review, this is the first time that the effect on the extraction efficiency of different types of organic modifiers in an extraction solvent is considered. This study demonstrates that numerous factors have great effect on extraction efficiency, such as the type of organic modifier and its percentage in extraction solvent, the number of extraction steps, the solid-to-solvent ratio, the extraction time and temperature and, in particular, the nature of analyte and their position within the grape skin cell. No matter that individual compounds belonging to the same group of flavonoids, their optimal extraction conditions may vary significantly. The great advantage of applying this new optimised UAE method is the reduction of operations throughout the extraction process; there is no longer a need for the organic modifier in the extraction solvent to be removed. Therefore, any possible errors that may arise during frequent sample transfer from one vessel to another can be avoided.
¡@Application of the developed method can be extended to grape seeds and grape marc (residual products obtained after the winemaking process) for the recovery of phenolic compounds. To achieve this, further experiments and adjustments will be conducted because these matrices are different from grape skin matrices.
