Article history:
Received 28 November 2014
Accepted 21 June 2015Northeast India is geographically nestled as one of the biodiversity hotspots, rich in traditionally used medicinal plants. Resveratrol, a naturally occurring phytoalexin found in berries, peanuts, grapes, red wine and also in numerous anthelmintic plants, has attracted wide interest because of its diverse pharmacological characteristics.
   
1. Introduction
   Gastrointestinal (GI) helminthes are the common infectious agents throughout the globe especially in the developed and developing countries and responsible for significant production loss in livestock and crop production industry globally (Brooker et al., 2010). In Northeast India, the genus Raillietina is the most common helminth parasite of poultry, accountable for malnutrition, retardation of growth of young chicken, emaciation of the adult and decreased egg production in hen (Kumar et al., 2007). The basic and most common control strategy adopted against helminth infections is the use of a limited number of commercial drugs. But the frequent and continuous use of specific drug leads to the development of anthelmintic resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to screen and develop drugs from plants which are supposed to be safe and biodegradable.
   Nature is an endless source of bioactive compounds and shows numerous biological activities. Resveratrol (RESV) was first isolated from the roots of white hellebore (Veratrum grandiflorum O. Loes) as early as 1940 and later in 1963 from the roots of Polygonum cuspidatum, a traditionally used Chinese and Japanese medicine (Takaoka, 1940; Nonomura et al., 1963). At present the compound is isolated from at least 72 plants species belongs to 12 families is abundant in edible foods and beverages such as mulberries, peanuts, grapes, red wine and sedges belong to the genus Carex (Bhat and Pezzuto, 2002; Signorelli and Ghidoni, 2005; Gonz?lez-Sarr?as et al., 2011). The compound is

produced by the plants to protect themselves against stress or infections viz., heat, insect, bacteria and fungi (Burns et al., 2002). Of the two isomeric forms cis- and trans-isomers of RESV, the trans-isomer is believed to be the most abundant, more stable and biologically more active (Bertelli et al., 1998). RESV possesses diverse biological and pharmacological effects like anticancer, cardio protective, antioxidant and antiaging activities (Dong, 2003; Bradamante et al., 2004; Baur et al., 2006; Iacopini et al., 2008). Presently, preliminary in vitro investigation carried out on different helminth parasites revealed that the crude extract of Carex baccans and RESV causes extensive damage in tegumental surface and sub-tegumental cellular components leading to death of the parasites (Challam et al., 2012; Giri and Roy, 2014).
   Among the three types of cell death (apoptosis, autophagy and necrosis) noticed in mammals, apoptosis is an energy dependent, tightly controlled programmed sequence of events that plays a crucial role in the regulation of tissue homeostasis (Lockshin and Zakeri, 2007). Modulating apoptosis through the treatment of different plant extract in helminth parasites has widen up the research related to screening and development of potential drug candidate. In this context several reports involving anthelmintic plant extracts or active phytochemicals reported to acts in helminth parasites through the process programmed cell death (Giri et al., 2013; Saini et al., 2014; Mukherjee et al., 2014).
   Though RESV is one of the most studied phytochemicals, its mechanism of action is not fully understood (Baur and Sinclair, 2006). Several experiments have shown that RESV is well tolerated by animals and does not have any genotoxic activity (Williams et al., 2009). However, our recent experiment revealed that RESV causes extensive tegumental deformation and inhibition of vital tegumental enzymes leading to death of helminth parasites, though the exact mechanism of action of the phytochemical is not unveiled. Therefore, the present study was conducted, to explore the possible mechanism of action of RESV in the poultry tapeworm, Raillietina echinobothrida.
2. Materials and method
2.1. Drugs and chemicals
   RESV (R5010), MTT [3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide], Rhodamine 123 (Rh123), AEC (3-Amino-9ethylcarbazole) were obtained from Sigma Chemicals (St. Louis, USA). All enzymes and co-enzymes were obtained either from Sigma chemicals or Sisco Research Laboratories (SRL, Mumbai, India). All the enzymes related to TUNEL assay were procured from Enzo life Sciences, UK. Other chemicals used were of analytical grade and obtained from Himedia (Mumbai, India). Millipore water was used for all reagent preparations.
2.2. In vitro experiment
   Live mature tapeworms (R. echinobothrida) were collected from the intestine of freshly slaughtered naturally infected domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus). After washing in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2), the test parasites were incubated at 37 ¡Ó 1 ¢XC with RESV (600 £gM/ml) dissolved in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in PBS. Control parasites were incubated in PBS containing 0.1% DMSO only. Five replicates assay were conducted independently for the experiment. 2.3. Parasite viability test by MTT assay
   Parasites assessed for motility, were further screened for MTT reduction assay, following the method of Comley et al. (1989) with slight modifications. At 6, 12, 18 and 23 h of exposure, parasites motility was checked using a binocular microscope and were suspended in 2 ml of PBS containing 1 mg MTT/ml and incubated for 2 h at 37 ¢XC in dark. The dark blue crystals of formazan formed were solubilized in 200 £gl of DMSO. The optical density was quantified with a double beam spectrophotometer (Cary 100 model, Varian) at 595 nm, using DMSO as a blank.
2.4. Ultrastructural studies
	Control	and	RESV	exposed	worms	were fixed	in	modified
Karnovsky's fixative, post-fixed in 1% OsO4 buffered with 0.2 M sodium cacodylate for 4 h, dehydrated through graded acetone and embedded in araldite. Ultrathin sections were stained with Uranyl acetate and Lead citrate, and viewed in a JEM 2100 CXII (JEOL) transmission electron microscope operated at 120 KV.
2.5. TUNEL assay
   DNA fragmentation at single cell level was determined by Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay as described earlier (Giri et al., 2013). Briefly, the control and RESV exposed (600 £gM/ml) parasites at different time periods (6, 12, 18 and 23 h) were subjected to cryomicrotomy (Leica CM 1850, Germany) at a thickness of 7¡V10 £gm. The sections were first fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and digested by proteinase K (20 £gg/ml) for 15 min at room temperature. Then the fragmented DNA was labeled by biotinylated nucleotide mix in the presence of deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) for 60 min in a humidified chamber and stopped the reaction by transferring the slides to termination buffer (300 mM NaCl, 30 mM Sodium citrate). The labeled fragments were then incubated with avidin-peroxidase and then with AEC (3-Amino-9-ethylcarbazole) for 30 min at 37 ¢XC. Finally the sections were counter stained with hematoxylin and photographed under a compound microscope (Leica DM 2000, Germany).
2.6. Detection of chromatin condensation by DAPI staining
   For the assessment of chromatin condensation and fragmentation, the sections were stained using 1 £gl/ml (Stock: 1 mg/ml) of DAPI in sterile PBS at room temperature. The stained sections were examined under confocal microscope (Leica, TCS SP5, Germany), using an excitation wavelength of 490 nm.
2.7. Detection of mitochondrial membrane potential (£G£Zm) by Rhodamine 123 (Rh123)
   Rh123 (R8004) was prepared in millipore water stored at ?20 ¢XC as aliquots of 100 £gg/ml solution and was diluted to 10 £gg/ml with PBS before use. After incubating in Rh123 for 30 min at 37 ¢XC, the parasite sections were washed thrice in preheating PBS. Then sections were observed under fluorescence microscope (Leica DM4000 B, Germany) at maximum excitation wave length 488 nm and emission wavelength of 590 nm. The relative intensity of the Rh123 was calculated using ImageJ software (V.1.45s, NIH, USA) from five individual micrographs of each group.
2.8. Detection of active caspase-3/7
   To confirm the involvement of caspases, activated caspase-3/7 was detected following the manufacturer's protocol from Invitrogen (Image-iT? LIVE Green Caspase-3/7 Detection Kit). Briefly at different time interval parasites were taken out from the incubation medium and subjected to cryomicrotomy at a thickness of 7¡V10 £gm. Sections were then labeled with FLICA reagent and incubated for 60 min at 37 ¢XC in dark. After incubation, the sections were washed in PBS, mounted in 1¡Ñ wash buffer, viewed and photographed under fluorescence microscope (Leica DM4000 B, Germany)
2.9. Statistical analysis
   Data were subjected to paired Student's t test and differences between controls vs. experimental groups at P ? 0.05 were considered as the threshold of significance. Data was represented as mean ¡Ó S.E.M.

B.R. Giri, B. Roy / Research in Veterinary Science 101 (2015) 120¡V1253. Results
3.1. Parasites viability
   Fig. 1 represents inhibition of viability in R. echinobothrida after exposure to RESV at different time intervals, carried out by MTT assay. The gradual reduction in the motility of the worms, as observed visually, corresponds to the decreased viability of the test parasites. The inhibition of viability in RESV exposed group was found to be highest at 23 h and lowest at 6 h of exposure compared to control and was statistically significant (P ? 0.05).
3.2. Ultrastructural observations
   Transmission electron micrographs of control worm showed a normal compact nucleus having distinct nucleolus, uniform and continuous nuclear membrane (Fig. 2A). Mitochondria of control worm showed normal mitochondrial outer membrane, cristae and matrix (Fig. 2B). At 12 h of exposure to RESV, the parasite showed wavy shaped nuclear membrane and disintegrated nucleolus (Fig. 2C). After 23 h of exposure to RESV, parasite showed complete disintegration and disruption of nucleus, nuclear membrane, nucleolus and condensed chromatin material throughout the nucleus (Fig. 2D). Similarly, RESV exposed parasite showed swelling and disruption of mitochondrial outer membrane and cristae (Fig. 2E). Progressions of cellular stress in the parasites were evident from the ultrastructural studies in a time dependent manner and are the characteristic features of apoptotic like cell death.
3.3. In situ DNA fragmentation assay
   DNA fragmentation in the RESV exposed R. echinobothrida was confirmed through TUNEL assay. Control parasite didn't reveal to have any apoptotic nuclei at 6 h, very less at 12, 18 and 23 h of incubation (Fig. 3A¡VD). On the other hand parasites exposed to RESV showed an increase in the number of apoptotic nuclei in the form of clusters of dark brown spots, indicating in situ DNA fragmentation at increasing time of incubation (Fig. 3E¡VH).
3.4. Chromatin condensation
   Transverse sections of control R. echinobothrida stained with DAPI revealed negligible condensations of chromatin at different time interval (Fig. 4A¡VD). However, RESV exposed worm revealed increased trend of chromatin condensation as the time of exposure increased (Fig. 4E¡VH).
3.5. Mitochondrial membrane potential (£G£Zm)
   Rh123 stained control parasites at different time intervals showed almost similar relative fluorescent intensity (Fig. 5). But in RESV exposed group, there was no noticeable change in the relative fluorescence intensity at 6 and 12 h of incubation. However, at 18 and 23 h of exposure there was significant decrease in the relative fluorescence intensity compared to respective control group.

3.6. Active caspase-3/7 detection
   In the control parasites a negligible or less activated caspase-3/7 at different time intervals from 12 to 23 h (Fig. 6A¡VD) were observed. However, increased levels of activated caspases in the worms exposed to RESV from 6 to 23 h were recorded (Fig. 6E¡VH).
4. Discussion
   The MTT test carried out in the present study revealed that the phytoalexin causes significant reduction in worm viability and reduction in viability increased when time of exposure increased. Similar to the present finding, Bernhard et al. (2003) also observed inhibition of lymphocytic leukemia cells exposed to RESV. Plant derived compounds like genistein, virosecurine, ursolic acid, RESV etc. have shown as promising anthelmintic agents when exposed to different helminthes like cestode (R. echinobothrida), trematode (Fasciolopsis buski) and nematodes (Ascaridia galli, Setaria cervi and Trichinella spiralis) (Ozkoc et al., 2009; Kar and Tandon, 2004; Roy et al., 2012; Dasgupta et al., 2013; Giri and Roy, 2014; Saini et al., 2014). RESV also reported to have antiprotozoan properties as it inhibit the growth of different protozoa like Leishmania major and Plasmodium falciparum (Kedzierski et al., 2007; Son et al., 2007).
   During last two decades, RESV attracted increasing attention due to its chemo-preventive potential towards the most severe disease such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease and aging. RESV was reported to have great influence on carcinogenesis by inhibiting cyclooxygenase and up regulating p53 pathway, which affects cancer initiation and progression (Jang et al., 1997; Dong, 2003). Another mechanism by which RESV could combat tumor formation is induction of cell cycle arrest through down regulating different proteins of cell cycle (Yu et al., 2003) and increases apoptosis (Garvin et al., 2006). It is also well known that RESV has antioxidant properties, however, the effect is through direct scavenging or by upregulating the antioxidant defense system is not yet clear. Morselli et al. (2010) observed that resveratrol promote caloric restriction and longevity through the Sirtuin-1-dependent induction of autophagy.
   Our present observations suggest that the cestocidal activity of RESV is mediated through induction of apoptosis like cell death, as observed through TUNEL assay and chromosomal condensation. Apoptosis is a multi-step, multi-pathway cell-death program that plays critical roles

in tissue homeostasis, development and conserved trough evolution. In the present study, DAPI stained nucleus of RESV exposed parasite showed clustered and fragmented nuclei which further confirm the occurrence of apoptotic cell death in R. echinobothrida. Similar to the present observations, filarial worm S. cervi exposed to the phytochemical curcumin also induced apoptotic cell death leading to death of the worm (Nayak et al., 2012). Ultrastructural observations on RESV exposed parasite revealed a progressive disintegration of plasma membrane, distorted and deformed nucleus, electron dense chromatin condensation along the inner surface of the nuclear envelope. These changes in nuclear ultrastructure are the characteristic morphological features of apoptosis. The nuclei of 23 h exposed cestode became multi-lobed with swelled nuclear membrane, which further confirm the process of apoptosis. A gradual reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (£G£Zm) with increase in exposure time and ultimately complete loss of £G£Zm at 23 h of exposure to RESV, as observed in the present study suggest that the induction of cell death by RESV is mitochondria mediated. Increase in the volume of mitochondria, disruption of cristae and mitochondrial membrane might leads to release of inner content of mitochondria to the cytoplasm, indicating probable involvement of intrinsic pathways of apoptosis exerted by RESV (Gottlieb et al., 2003). In addition to energy metabolism mitochondria also regulate cell death mechanism because of the ability of trafficking pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins (Yang et al., 1997). Similar to our observation, Sun et al. (2007) observed that 50% of cytochrome c release complete at 16¡V18 h of exposure to apoptotic agent and almost complete at 20 h, due to complete loss of £G£Zm. The decrease in £G£Zm promotes the activation of executioner caspases as observed in the present study. In most of the cases caspase activity is crucial for apoptosis to occur and a complex regulatory system maintains their silence in normally dividing cells. Caspase family is the key mediator of apoptosis, executed by cleaving critical cellular proteins at aspartic acid residues (Degterev et al., 2003). The convergences of different pathways activate caspase-3 and 7, which then leads to activation of a series of irreversible events that degrades DNA and initiates chromatin condensation (Elmore, 2007). An increased expression of activated caspases viz. caspase-3/7 as detected in RESV exposed parasites supports the fact that RESV induced apoptosis like cell death in R. echinobothrida is caspase dependent.
5. Conclusion

Fig. 6. Fluorescence micrographs showing caspase 3/7 in control (A¡VD) and resveratrol exposed (E¡VH) R. echinobothrida. A¡VD. Photographs showing no active caspase (3/7) activities in control R. echinobothrida at different time periods. E¡VH. Photographs showing an increased trend of caspase activity at ascending period of exposure to RESV. All scale bars = 20 £gm.   Inhibition of viability of parasite as observed in the present study is due to the alterations in cellular organelles, which in turn activates caspases through compromising mitochondrial membrane potential. Thus the current investigation presents several remarkable evidences of apoptosis like cell death and suggests that the cestocidal activity of RESV is through induction of mitochondria mediated cell death. However, to elucidate the detail mechanism of apoptosis in R. echinobothrida, it is necessary to accomplish molecular approach to describe the mechanism underlying the induction of programmed cell death by RESV. This would help us to understand the possible apoptotic pathway in the cestode parasite to develop a new cestocidal drug of medico veterinary importance.
